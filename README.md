Proxify Manual Testing Project

Project Overview

Proxify is a service that provides access to a network of professional developers for hire. The website (https://proxify.gg/dashboard) offers various plans tailored to different needs, such as part-time, full-time, or project-based development work. This project involves conducting manual testing on the website and documenting various testing artifacts, including test plans, test cases, defect reports, and summary reports.

Scope of Testing

The scope of manual testing covers the following modules:

Dashboard: Verifying the navigation, UI elements, and data consistency.

Plans: Ensuring that different plans are displayed correctly with accurate details.

Invoices: Checking the invoice generation, download functionality, and data correctness.

Top-up: Validating the payment processing system and transaction records.

Referrals: Testing referral links, earnings calculations, and copy link functionality.

Testing Approach

This project follows a structured manual testing approach, including:

Functional Testing: Ensuring each feature works as expected.

UI/UX Testing: Checking for design consistency, responsiveness, and user experience.

Regression Testing: Verifying that new changes do not introduce defects.

Boundary Value Analysis: Testing input fields with minimum and maximum values.

Error Handling Testing: Checking how the system responds to invalid inputs and unexpected scenarios.

Agile Methodology in Testing

The testing process follows Agile Methodology to ensure continuous and iterative testing:

Sprint-based Testing: Testing activities are divided into multiple sprints.

Daily Stand-up Meetings: Discussing test progress, blockers, and solutions.

Collaboration with Developers: Continuous integration with the development team.

Frequent Builds & Releases: Ensuring testing is performed on updated builds.

Exploratory Testing: Ad-hoc testing to uncover hidden defects.
